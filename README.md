# Student Mark Management System

This is a student mark management system using python.

This Python program predicts student progression outcomes based on their credit scores at the end of each academic year. It validates inputs, supports multiple student entries, and generates a histogram of outcomes. The program also stores data in lists, text files, and dictionaries.

Features
Progression Prediction: Predicts whether a student progresses, trailers, retrieves modules, or is excluded based on their credit scores.
Input Validation: Ensures input is an integer, within valid ranges, and totals 120 credits.
Multiple Entries: Allows input for multiple students in a single run.
Histogram Display: Visual representation of outcomes for all students entered.
Data Storage: Saves input data to lists, text files, and dictionaries for easy access and display.

Usage
Run the program and follow the prompts to input credit scores. Use 'q' to quit and view the histogram of outcomes. Data is stored and retrieved efficiently for further analysis.
